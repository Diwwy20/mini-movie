## Steps to Run the Project

### Important Note on `.env` File

Please note that **the `.env` file should not be pushed to Git** for security reasons as it often contains sensitive information such as API keys, database credentials, etc. If you need to add environment variables, you can create your own `.env` file locally.

An example `.env` file might be included in the repository for demonstration purposes, but it **should not** be used in production. Always make sure to create your own `.env` file to avoid exposing sensitive data.
